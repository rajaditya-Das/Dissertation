Data and Code related to my master's dissertation project
'Primary.xslx' is the raw unedited data entry sheet
'Rajaditya_MS_data.csv' is edited to update it with a clearer plot nomenclature. Sheet2 of 'Primary.xslx' contains the ID key in case of some requirement.
'ms data with dry.csv' is the data sheet used for the R code analysis. It includes dry mass for the species shortlisted from the total dataset 'Rajaditya_MS_data'.
